> **Autonomous AI development loop with intelligent exit detection and rate limiting**

Ralph is an implementation of the Geoffrey Huntley's technique for Claude Code that enables continuous autonomous development cycles he named after [Ralph Wiggum](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/). It enables continuous autonomous development cycles where Claude Code iteratively improves your project until completion, with built-in safeguards to prevent infinite loops and API overuse.

**Install once, use everywhere** - Ralph becomes a global command available in any directory.

## Project Status

**Version**: v0.11.5 - Active Development
**Core Features**: Working and tested
**Test Coverage**: 566 tests, 100% pass rate

### What's Working Now
- Autonomous development loops with intelligent exit detection
- **Dual-condition exit gate**: Requires BOTH completion indicators AND explicit EXIT_SIGNAL
- Rate limiting with hourly reset (100 calls/hour, configurable)
- Circuit breaker with advanced error detection (prevents runaway loops)
- Response analyzer with semantic understanding and two-stage error filtering
- **JSON output format support with automatic fallback to text parsing**
- **Session continuity with `--resume` flag for context preservation (no session hijacking)**
- **Session expiration with configurable timeout (default: 24 hours)**
- **Modern CLI flags: `--output-format`, `--allowed-tools`, `--no-continue`**
- **Interactive project enablement with `ralph-enable` wizard**
- **`.ralphrc` configuration file for project settings**
- **Live streaming output with `--live` flag for real-time Claude Code visibility**
- Multi-line error matching for accurate stuck loop detection
- 5-hour API limit handling with user prompts
- tmux integration for live monitoring
- PRD import functionality
- **CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions**
- **Dedicated uninstall script for clean removal**

## Quick Start

Ralph has two phases: **one-time installation** and **per-project setup**.

```
INSTALL ONCE              USE MANY TIMES
+-----------------+          +----------------------+
| ./install.sh    |    ->    | ralph-setup project1 |
|                 |          | ralph-enable         |
| Adds global     |          | ralph-import prd.md  |
| commands        |          | ...                  |
+-----------------+          +----------------------+
```

### Phase 1: Install Ralph (One Time Only)

Install Ralph globally on your system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code.git
cd ralph-claude-code
./install.sh
```

This adds `ralph`, `ralph-monitor`, `ralph-setup`, `ralph-import`, `ralph-migrate`, `ralph-enable`, and `ralph-enable-ci` commands to your PATH.

> **Note**: You only need to do this once per system. After installation, you can delete the cloned repository if desired.

### Phase 2: Initialize Projects (Per Project)

#### Option A: Enable Ralph in Existing Project (Recommended)
```bash
cd my-existing-project

# Interactive wizard - auto-detects project type and imports tasks
ralph-enable

# Or with specific task source
ralph-enable --from beads
ralph-enable --from github --label "sprint-1"
ralph-enable --from prd ./docs/requirements.md

# Start autonomous development
ralph --monitor
```

#### Option B: Import Existing PRD/Specifications
```bash
# Convert existing PRD/specs to Ralph format
ralph-import my-requirements.md my-project
cd my-project

# Review and adjust the generated files:
# - .ralph/PROMPT.md (Ralph instructions)
# - .ralph/fix_plan.md (task priorities)
# - .ralph/specs/requirements.md (technical specs)

# Start autonomous development
ralph --monitor
```

#### Option C: Create New Project from Scratch
```bash
# Create blank Ralph project
ralph-setup my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project

# Configure your project requirements manually
# Edit .ralph/PROMPT.md with your project goals
# Edit .ralph/specs/ with detailed specifications
# Edit .ralph/fix_plan.md with initial priorities

# Start autonomous development
ralph --monitor
```

### Ongoing Usage (After Setup)

Once Ralph is installed and your project is initialized:

```bash
# Navigate to any Ralph project and run:
ralph --monitor              # Integrated tmux monitoring (recommended)

# Or use separate terminals:
ralph                        # Terminal 1: Ralph loop
ralph-monitor               # Terminal 2: Live monitor dashboard
```

### Uninstalling Ralph

To completely remove Ralph from your system:

```bash
# Run the uninstall script
./uninstall.sh

# Or if you deleted the repo, download and run:
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

## Understanding Ralph Files

After running `ralph-enable` or `ralph-import`, you'll have a `.ralph/` directory with several files. Here's what each file does and whether you need to edit it:

| File | Auto-Generated? | You Should... |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| `.ralph/PROMPT.md` | Yes (smart defaults) | **Review & customize** project goals and principles |
| `.ralph/fix_plan.md` | Yes (can import tasks) | **Add/modify** specific implementation tasks |
| `.ralph/AGENT.md` | Yes (detects build commands) | Rarely edit (auto-maintained by Ralph) |
| `.ralph/specs/` | Empty directory | Add files when PROMPT.md isn't detailed enough |
| `.ralph/specs/stdlib/` | Empty directory | Add reusable patterns and conventions |
| `.ralphrc` | Yes (project-aware) | Rarely edit (sensible defaults) |

### Key File Relationships

```
PROMPT.md (high-level goals)
    ↓
specs/ (detailed requirements when needed)
    ↓
fix_plan.md (specific tasks Ralph executes)
    ↓
AGENT.md (build/test commands - auto-maintained)
```

### When to Use specs/

- **Simple projects**: PROMPT.md + fix_plan.md is usually enough
- **Complex features**: Add specs/feature-name.md for detailed requirements
- **Team conventions**: Add specs/stdlib/convention-name.md for reusable patterns

See the [User Guide](docs/user-guide/) for detailed explanations and the [examples/](examples/) directory for realistic project configurations.

## How It Works

Ralph operates on a simple but powerful cycle:

1. **Read Instructions** - Loads `PROMPT.md` with your project requirements
2. **Execute Claude Code** - Runs Claude Code with current context and priorities
3. **Track Progress** - Updates task lists and logs execution results
4. **Evaluate Completion** - Checks for exit conditions and project completion signals
5. **Repeat** - Continues until project is complete or limits are reached

### Intelligent Exit Detection

Ralph uses a **dual-condition check** to prevent premature exits during productive iterations:

**Exit requires BOTH conditions:**
1. `completion_indicators >= 2` (heuristic detection from natural language patterns)
2. Claude's explicit `EXIT_SIGNAL: true` in the RALPH_STATUS block

**Example behavior:**
```
Loop 5: Claude outputs "Phase complete, moving to next feature"
        → completion_indicators: 3 (high confidence from patterns)
        → EXIT_SIGNAL: false (Claude says more work needed)
        → Result: CONTINUE (respects Claude's explicit intent)

Loop 8: Claude outputs "All tasks complete, project ready"
        → completion_indicators: 4
        → EXIT_SIGNAL: true (Claude confirms done)
        → Result: EXIT with "project_complete"
```

**Other exit conditions:**
- All tasks in `.ralph/fix_plan.md` marked complete
- Multiple consecutive "done" signals from Claude Code
- Too many test-focused loops (indicating feature completeness)
- Claude API 5-hour usage limit reached (with user prompt to wait or exit)

## Enabling Ralph in Existing Projects

The `ralph-enable` command provides an interactive wizard for adding Ralph to existing projects:

```bash
cd my-existing-project
ralph-enable
```

**The wizard:**
1. **Detects Environment** - Identifies project type (TypeScript, Python, etc.) and framework
2. **Selects Task Sources** - Choose from beads, GitHub Issues, or PRD documents
3. **Configures Settings** - Set tool permissions and loop parameters
4. **Generates Files** - Creates `.ralph/` directory and `.ralphrc` configuration
5. **Verifies Setup** - Confirms all files are created correctly

**Non-interactive mode for CI/automation:**
```bash
ralph-enable-ci                              # Sensible defaults
ralph-enable-ci --from github               # Import from GitHub Issues
ralph-enable-ci --project-type typescript   # Override detection
ralph-enable-ci --json                      # Machine-readable output
```

## Importing Existing Requirements

Ralph can convert existing PRDs, specifications, or requirement documents into the proper Ralph format using Claude Code.

### Supported Formats
- **Markdown** (.md) - Product requirements, technical specs
- **Text files** (.txt) - Plain text requirements
- **JSON** (.json) - Structured requirement data
- **Word documents** (.docx) - Business requirements
- **PDFs** (.pdf) - Design documents, specifications
- **Any text-based format** - Ralph will intelligently parse the content

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Convert a markdown PRD
ralph-import product-requirements.md my-app

# Convert a text specification
ralph-import requirements.txt webapp

# Convert a JSON API spec
ralph-import api-spec.json backend-service

# Let Ralph auto-name the project from filename
ralph-import design-doc.pdf
```

### What Gets Generated

Ralph-import creates a complete project with:

- **.ralph/PROMPT.md** - Converted into Ralph development instructions
- **.ralph/fix_plan.md** - Requirements broken down into prioritized tasks
- **.ralph/specs/requirements.md** - Technical specifications extracted from your document
- **.ralphrc** - Project configuration file with tool permissions
- **Standard Ralph structure** - All necessary directories and template files in `.ralph/`

The conversion is intelligent and preserves your original requirements while making them actionable for autonomous development.

## Configuration

### Project Configuration (.ralphrc)

Each Ralph project can have a `.ralphrc` configuration file:

```bash
# .ralphrc - Ralph project configuration
PROJECT_NAME="my-project"
PROJECT_TYPE="typescript"

# Claude Code CLI command (auto-detected, override if needed)
CLAUDE_CODE_CMD="claude"
# CLAUDE_CODE_CMD="npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code"  # Alternative: use npx

# Loop settings
MAX_CALLS_PER_HOUR=100
CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=15
CLAUDE_OUTPUT_FORMAT="json"

# Tool permissions
ALLOWED_TOOLS="Write,Read,Edit,Bash(git *),Bash(npm *),Bash(pytest)"

# Session management
SESSION_CONTINUITY=true
SESSION_EXPIRY_HOURS=24

# Circuit breaker thresholds
CB_NO_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD=3
CB_SAME_ERROR_THRESHOLD=5
```

### Rate Limiting & Circuit Breaker

Ralph includes intelligent rate limiting and circuit breaker functionality:

```bash
# Default: 100 calls per hour
ralph --calls 50

# With integrated monitoring
ralph --monitor --calls 50

# Check current usage
ralph --status
```

The circuit breaker automatically:
- Detects API errors and rate limit issues with advanced two-stage filtering
- Opens circuit after 3 loops with no progress or 5 loops with same errors
- Eliminates false positives from JSON fields containing "error"
- Accurately detects stuck loops with multi-line error matching
- Gradually recovers with half-open monitoring state
- **Auto-recovers** after cooldown period (default: 30 minutes) — OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED
- Provides detailed error tracking and logging with state history

**Auto-recovery options:**
```bash
# Default: 30-minute cooldown before auto-recovery attempt
CB_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=30     # Set in .ralphrc (0 = immediate)

# Auto-reset on startup (for fully unattended operation)
ralph --auto-reset-circuit
# Or set in .ralphrc: CB_AUTO_RESET=true
```

### Claude API 5-Hour Limit

When Claude's 5-hour usage limit is reached, Ralph:
1. Detects the limit using three-layer verification (timeout guard → structural JSON → filtered text fallback)
2. Prompts you to choose:
   - **Option 1**: Wait 60 minutes for the limit to reset (with countdown timer)
   - **Option 2**: Exit gracefully
3. **Unattended mode**: Auto-waits on prompt timeout (30s) instead of exiting
4. Prevents false positives from echoed file content mentioning "5-hour limit"

### Custom Prompts

```bash
# Use custom prompt file
ralph --prompt my_custom_instructions.md

# With integrated monitoring
ralph --monitor --prompt my_custom_instructions.md
```

### Execution Timeouts

```bash
# Set Claude Code execution timeout (default: 15 minutes)
ralph --timeout 30  # 30-minute timeout for complex tasks

# With monitoring and custom timeout
ralph --monitor --timeout 60  # 60-minute timeout

# Short timeout for quick iterations
ralph --verbose --timeout 5  # 5-minute timeout with progress
```

### Verbose Mode

```bash
# Enable detailed progress updates during execution
ralph --verbose

# Combine with other options
ralph --monitor --verbose --timeout 30
```

### Live Streaming Output

```bash
# Enable real-time visibility into Claude Code execution
ralph --live

# Combine with monitoring for best experience
ralph --monitor --live

# Live output is written to .ralph/live.log
tail -f .ralph/live.log  # Watch in another terminal
```

Live streaming mode shows Claude Code's output in real-time as it works, providing visibility into what's happening during each loop iteration.

### Session Continuity

Ralph maintains session context across loop iterations for improved coherence:

```bash
# Sessions are enabled by default with --continue flag
ralph --monitor                 # Uses session continuity

# Start fresh without session context
ralph --no-continue             # Isolated iterations

# Reset session manually (clears context)
ralph --reset-session           # Clears current session

# Check session status
cat .ralph/.ralph_session              # View current session file
cat .ralph/.ralph_session_history      # View session transition history
```

**Session Auto-Reset Triggers:**
- Circuit breaker opens (stagnation detected)
- Manual interrupt (Ctrl+C / SIGINT)
- Project completion (graceful exit)
- Manual circuit breaker reset (`--reset-circuit`)
- Session expiration (default: 24 hours)

Sessions are persisted to `.ralph/.ralph_session` with a configurable expiration (default: 24 hours). The last 50 session transitions are logged to `.ralph/.ralph_session_history` for debugging.

### Exit Thresholds

Modify these variables in `~/.ralph/ralph_loop.sh`:

**Exit Detection Thresholds:**
```bash
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TEST_LOOPS=3     # Exit after 3 test-only loops
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_DONE_SIGNALS=2   # Exit after 2 "done" signals
TEST_PERCENTAGE_THRESHOLD=30     # Flag if 30%+ loops are test-only
```

**Circuit Breaker Thresholds:**
```bash
CB_NO_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD=3       # Open circuit after 3 loops with no file changes
CB_SAME_ERROR_THRESHOLD=5        # Open circuit after 5 loops with repeated errors
CB_OUTPUT_DECLINE_THRESHOLD=70   # Open circuit if output declines by >70%
CB_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=30           # Minutes before OPEN → HALF_OPEN auto-recovery
CB_AUTO_RESET=false              # true = reset to CLOSED on startup (bypasses cooldown)
```

**Completion Indicators with EXIT_SIGNAL Gate:**

| completion_indicators | EXIT_SIGNAL | Result |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------|
| >= 2 | `true` | **Exit** ("project_complete") |
| >= 2 | `false` | **Continue** (Claude still working) |
| >= 2 | missing | **Continue** (defaults to false) |
| < 2 | `true` | **Continue** (threshold not met) |

## Project Structure

Ralph creates a standardized structure for each project with a `.ralph/` subfolder for configuration:

```
my-project/
├── .ralph/                 # Ralph configuration and state (hidden folder)
│   ├── PROMPT.md           # Main development instructions for Ralph
│   ├── fix_plan.md        # Prioritized task list
│   ├── AGENT.md           # Build and run instructions
│   ├── specs/              # Project specifications and requirements
│   │   └── stdlib/         # Standard library specifications
│   ├── examples/           # Usage examples and test cases
│   ├── logs/               # Ralph execution logs
│   └── docs/generated/     # Auto-generated documentation
├── .ralphrc                # Ralph configuration file (tool permissions, settings)
└── src/                    # Source code implementation (at project root)
```

> **Migration**: If you have existing Ralph projects using the old flat structure, run `ralph-migrate` to automatically move files to the `.ralph/` subfolder.

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts

1. **Be Specific** - Clear requirements lead to better results
2. **Prioritize** - Use `.ralph/fix_plan.md` to guide Ralph's focus
3. **Set Boundaries** - Define what's in/out of scope
4. **Include Examples** - Show expected inputs/outputs

### Project Specifications

- Place detailed requirements in `.ralph/specs/`
- Use `.ralph/fix_plan.md` for prioritized task tracking
- Keep `.ralph/AGENT.md` updated with build instructions
- Document key decisions and architecture

### Monitoring Progress

- Use `ralph-monitor` for live status updates
- Check logs in `.ralph/logs/` for detailed execution history
- Monitor `.ralph/status.json` for programmatic access
- Watch for exit condition signals

## System Requirements

- **Bash 4.0+** - For script execution
- **Claude Code CLI** - `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` (or use npx — set `CLAUDE_CODE_CMD` in `.ralphrc`)
- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer for integrated monitoring (recommended)
- **jq** - JSON processing for status tracking
- **Git** - Version control (projects are initialized as git repos)
- **GNU coreutils** - For the `timeout` command (execution timeouts)
  - Linux: Pre-installed on most distributions
  - macOS: Install via `brew install coreutils` (provides `gtimeout`)
- **Standard Unix tools** - grep, date, etc.

### Testing Requirements (Development)

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the comprehensive testing guide.

If you want to run the test suite:

```bash
# Install BATS testing framework
npm install -g bats bats-support bats-assert

# Run all tests (566 tests)
npm test

# Run specific test suites
bats tests/unit/test_rate_limiting.bats
bats tests/unit/test_exit_detection.bats
bats tests/unit/test_json_parsing.bats
bats tests/unit/test_cli_modern.bats
bats tests/unit/test_cli_parsing.bats
bats tests/unit/test_session_continuity.bats
bats tests/unit/test_enable_core.bats
bats tests/unit/test_task_sources.bats
bats tests/unit/test_ralph_enable.bats
bats tests/unit/test_wizard_utils.bats
bats tests/unit/test_circuit_breaker_recovery.bats
bats tests/integration/test_loop_execution.bats
bats tests/integration/test_prd_import.bats
bats tests/integration/test_project_setup.bats
bats tests/integration/test_installation.bats

# Run error detection and circuit breaker tests
./tests/test_error_detection.sh
./tests/test_stuck_loop_detection.sh
```

Current test status:
- **566 tests** across 18 test files
- **100% pass rate** (556/556 passing)
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Specialized tests for JSON parsing, CLI flags, circuit breaker, EXIT_SIGNAL behavior, enable wizard, and installation workflows

> **Note on Coverage**: Bash code coverage measurement with kcov has fundamental limitations when tracing subprocess executions. Test pass rate (100%) is the quality gate. See [bats-core#15](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core/issues/15) for details.

### Installing tmux

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install tmux

# macOS
brew install tmux

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install tmux
```

### Installing GNU coreutils (macOS)

Ralph uses the `timeout` command for execution timeouts. On macOS, you need to install GNU coreutils:

```bash
# Install coreutils (provides gtimeout)
brew install coreutils

# Verify installation
gtimeout --version
```

Ralph automatically detects and uses `gtimeout` on macOS. No additional configuration is required after installation.

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Live Dashboard

```bash
# Integrated tmux monitoring (recommended)
ralph --monitor

# Manual monitoring in separate terminal
ralph-monitor
```

Shows real-time:
- Current loop count and status
- API calls used vs. limit
- Recent log entries
- Rate limit countdown

**tmux Controls:**
- `Ctrl+B` then `D` - Detach from session (keeps Ralph running)
- `Ctrl+B` then `←/→` - Switch between panes
- `tmux list-sessions` - View active sessions
- `tmux attach -t <session-name>` - Reattach to session

### Status Checking

```bash
# JSON status output
ralph --status

# Manual log inspection
tail -f .ralph/logs/ralph.log
```

### Common Issues

- **Ralph exits silently on first loop** - Claude Code CLI may not be installed or not in PATH. Ralph validates the command at startup and shows installation instructions. If using npx, add `CLAUDE_CODE_CMD="npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code"` to `.ralphrc`
- **Rate Limits** - Ralph automatically waits and displays countdown
- **5-Hour API Limit** - Ralph detects and prompts for user action (wait or exit)
- **Stuck Loops** - Check `fix_plan.md` for unclear or conflicting tasks
- **Early Exit** - Review exit thresholds if Ralph stops too soon
- **Premature Exit** - Check if Claude is setting `EXIT_SIGNAL: false` (Ralph now respects this)
- **Execution Timeouts** - Increase `--timeout` value for complex operations
- **Missing Dependencies** - Ensure Claude Code CLI and tmux are installed
- **tmux Session Lost** - Use `tmux list-sessions` and `tmux attach` to reconnect
- **Session Expired** - Sessions expire after 24 hours by default; use `--reset-session` to start fresh
- **timeout: command not found (macOS)** - Install GNU coreutils: `brew install coreutils`
- **Permission Denied** - Ralph halts when Claude Code is denied permission for commands:
  1. Edit `.ralphrc` and update `ALLOWED_TOOLS` to include required tools
  2. Common patterns: `Bash(npm *)`, `Bash(git *)`, `Bash(pytest)`
  3. Run `ralph --reset-session` after updating `.ralphrc`
  4. Restart with `ralph --monitor`
